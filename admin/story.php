    <p>Imagine the ideal coach. Regardless of the sport or purpose, they lead a team but they also lead individuals. That team brings together diverse amounts experience and ability. The passion that keeps them up it night is a vision of, not just what the team could accomplish, but the potential each team member could achieve. From the member just starting out, to the member ready for the ultimate challenge and ever member at a place on the path somewhere in between. As coach and team journey together, some members experience change and challenge. The path turns unexpectedly. The difficulty requires more rest than anticipated. The coach remains steady, offering the best strategy and support for continued progress. Balancing the needs of the team and the individuals who comprise it, the coach is both in charge and in touch, practical and inspirational, present minded and forward thinking.</p>
    <p>As a team member your feel like a person, not just a number.  You feel confident in your value but willing to sacrifice for the success of the team. You feel strong enough to accomplish anything, not because you know so much, but because you are surrounded by so many who feel the same way. </p>
    <p>This is Sanders. The visionary coach brand of real estate brokerages. </p>
