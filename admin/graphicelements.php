    <div class="col-md-3 d-flex align-items-center ">
      <p>The easiest way to make a strong brand statement is to combine a bold, well written headline with the brand mark. For this purpose, you can separate the bar and the arrow of the A icon. Use the width of the first 2-3 letters of the headline to guide your sizing. Make sure the space between the logo elements and the type is the same height as the height of the bar. </p>

      </a>

      <p class="mt-3">A repeating pattern is a great way to fill a large area with texture. This pattern works best when it is cropped at the angle of the A's on the left or the right. Color it this way with a slightly lighter shade over a darker shade or try the reverse. The right look is subtle texture, not dramatic contrast.</p>

      <h6 class="pt-3">Stacked Arrows</h6>
      <p>This element represents the 3 tier Real Path product and is depicted in the animation of Sanders logos. It can be used large or small and looks best when it spans from top to bottom of a confined space. Align towards the left or right of a layout. Color it with Real Gold or one of the shades overlaying its corresponding secondary color. Use as a solid shape as shown or outlined. </p>

      <h6 class="pt-3">Diagonal Color Blocking</h6>
      <p>This color blocking panel should be used only on the right side of an image or frame. It can be colored this way and paired with any color in the palette or it can be colored as a secondary color and paired with another secondary color to create a bold and energetic layout.</p>



      <p>This shape should always match the angle of the A icon, span from top to bottom of its container, and match the width of the A icon at the top. </p>

      <p class="mt-3">This pattern comprised of outlined arrows from the Sanders A icon can be arranged at will to complement type and decorate large amounts of space. It can be used with or without the filled logo elements which can provide an extra layer of storytelling especially when this element is paired with messaging.</p>

      <h6 class="pt-3">White Curves on Color</h6>
      <p>Freeflowing curves like these bring a friendly and organic feel to the more structural elements of the Sanders brand language. They signify the flexibilty included in Sanders Real Estate career. Use them with copy, integrated into photography or as decorative background imagery. </p>



<p>Do not use more than 3 together at a time. The path itself should be nearly the same thickness as the opening in the arrow. Arrows should always be pointing vertically or at an angle up and to the right. </p>

      <p>Color the curves and background freely to best support the message without distracting the viewer from more important content. </p>



<p>Curves should always come from the edge of a shape, page or image. </p>
